Energy, a quintessential private good, poses a conundrum for planners. The weaknesses of the argument that public goods are proper domain of planning become quite apparent, when we consider energy production and transmission infrastructure. Production of useful energy is a highly technical process, yet the political implications of such production and transmission inevitably draws planners into the conversation.

In this thread of research, I seek to understand how traditional planning at the local and regional level wittingly and unwittingly intersect with energy production and consumption. In particular, I am interested in the idea that local governments can use their influence on urban form to influence energy production and consumption.
