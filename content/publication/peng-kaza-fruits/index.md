abstract: 'Objective: To determine whether neighbourhood supermarket and convenience
  store availability and broader built environment context are associated with food
  purchasing behaviour in a national population.  Design: We used observational data
  to perform a cross-sectional study of food purchases for US households in 2010.
  We used three-level mixed-effect regression models to determine whether the associations
  between the number of neighbourhood supermarkets and convenience stores and the
  self-reported annual household expenditures for fruits and vegetables were affected
  by regional destination accessibility, neighbourhood destination diversity, availability
  of neighbourhood destinations and neighbourhood street connectivity.  Setting: Metropolitan
  statistical areas (n 378) in the USA. Participants: Households (n 22 448).  Results:
  Controlling for broader built environment context, there was no significant association
  between availability of neighbourhood supermarkets and expenditures on fruits and
  vegetables; instead, we observed an inverse association between the number of convenience
  stores and expenditures for fruits (P = 0路001). The broader built environment context
  was associated with food purchase, although the magnitude was small: (i) higher
  regional destination accessibility was associated with higher expenditures for fruits
  (P < 0路001); (ii) higher neighbourhood destination diversity was associated with
  lower expenditures for vegetables (P = 0路002); and (iii) higher neighbourhood street
  connectivity was  associated with higher expenditures for fruits (P < 0路001).  Conclusions:
  The broader built environment factors contributed to understanding how people use
  neighbourhood food stores. However, there was only a small relationship between
  the broader environment context and fruit and vegetable expenditures. Policy interventions
  that focus exclusively on increasing the availability of neighbourhood supermarkets
  likely will not promote fruit and vegetable consumption.'
