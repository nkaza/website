abstract: Deliberative democracy often presumes that the deliberators are members
  of a political community that often share common understanding about their values,
  even when they disagree about them. Participatory planning processes building upon
  these ideas argue that planning itself has to be communicative among a variety of
  interest groups and should, usually, result in a common consensus. However, the
  boundaries of these groups rarely get attention. These boundaries shape not only
  the discursive practices within groups but also among them, and therefore need to
  be examined more thoroughly. Furthermore, the relationship of membership to substantive
  issues of planning is important yet underexplored. Political membership in a diverse,
  mobile, transient and multi-cultural world is a contested subject and should be
  given deserving attention for its implications for planning practice.
