abstract: We aim to find agglomerations of U.S. counties that are partitioned by commuting
  patterns by representing inter-county commuting patterns as a weighted network.
  We develop and use a community detection method based on the  configuration model
  to identify significant clusters of nodes in a weighted network that prominently
  feature self-loops which represent same-county commuting.   After we apply this
  method to county level commuting data from 2010, we find regions that are significantly
  different from existing delineations such as Metropolitian Statistical Areas and
  Megaregions. Our method identifies regions with varying sizes as well as highly
  overlapping regions. Some counties belong to as many as six different statistically
  significant clusters but some do not belong to any. Our results offer an alternative
  way of categorizing economic regions from existing methods and suggest that geographical
  delineations should be rethought.
