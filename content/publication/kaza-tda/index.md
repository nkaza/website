abstract: Many place based accessibility studies ignore the time component. Relying
  on theoretical frameworks that treat distance between two fixed points as constant,
  these methods ignore the diurnal and seasonal changes in accessibility. Furthermore,
  network distances between two nodes are dependent on the network structure and weight
  distribution on the edges. These weights can change quite frequently and the network
  structure itself is subject to modification because of availability and unavailability
  of links and nodes. All these reasons, point to considering the implications of
  time variation in accessibility of a place. Using the case of transit, where all
  these feature are readily apparent simultaneously, I demonstrate the volatility
  in accessibility for two counties in North Carolina. Significant diurnal changes
  are observed in quarter of the locations and in the rest the changes are minimal
  mostly because of low levels of transit accessibility. I argue not for minimizing
  the volatility, but for acknowledging its impacts on mode choices, location choices
  and therefore on spatial structure of cities.
