abstract: "Problem: Given the extent of deindustrialization since the late 1970s,\
  \ many cities are forced to deal with a legacy of vacant and environmentally damaged\
  \ industrial land.  Urban economic development strategies have also turned away\
  \ from manufacturing, towards attracting high-skill service sector jobs. Thus, it\
  \ is of no surprise that planners, to date, have been focused on converting vacant\
  \ industrial parcels within the city into more `residentiary' uses and deliberately\
  \ directing public infrastructure investment elsewhere.  However, the recent resurgence\
  \ in manufacturing in the aftermath of the Great Recession and the transformation\
  \ of many goods-producing sectors offers an opportunity that may bypass urban areas\
  \ that do not preserve industrial land or view it as complementary to other uses.\
  \ Research Strategy and Findings: To this end, we develop an index of vulnerability\
  \ of industrial land that is based on location factors, neighborhood dynamics, detailed\
  \ industrial trends, environmental hazards, and local regulations.  We show for\
  \ the cases of Cook County, IL and Mecklenburg County, NC how these factors can\
  \ explain the conversion probability and how various industrial preservation strategies\
  \ counteract these vulnerabilities. We use a logit model formulation with detailed\
  \ parcel data and establishment time series data to derive the index of vulnerability.\
  \ Takeaway for Practice: This index can be used to strategically plan for which\
  \ industries to target and which sites to preserve as industrial uses. The statistical\
  \ models suggest that traditional planning and regulatory tools such as industrial\
  \ zone designations do reduce conversion risk and factors such as transit accessibility\
  \ increase the vulnerability of conversion. We argue that local governments should\
  \ be strategic about which manufacturing industries can be preserved at what locations\
  \ using these tools. We also develop and demonstrate an open source interactive\
  \ web-based tool that demonstrates some of the key concepts that can be replicated\
  \ in other places."
