abstract: Residential energy consumption accounts for 22% of the total energy consumption
  in the US. However, the impacts of local planning policies, such as increasing density
  and changing the housing type mix, on residential energy consumption are not well
  understood. Using Residential Energy Consumption Survey Data from the Energy Information
  Administration, quantile regression analysis was used to tease out the effects of
  various factors on entire distribution on the energy consumption spectrum instead
  of focusing on the conditional average. Results show that while housing size matters
  for space conditioning, housing type has a more nuanced impact. Self-reported neighborhood
  density does not seem to have any impact on energy use. Furthermore, the effects
  of these factors at the tails of the energy use distribution are substantially different
  than the average, in some cases differing by a factor of six. Some, not all, types
  of multifamily housing offer almost as much savings as reduction in housing area
  by 100 m2, compared to single family houses.
