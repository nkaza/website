abstract: 'Problem: The practice of scenario plan- ning is often too focused on developing
  a single preferred scenario and fails to adequately consider multiple uncertain
  futures. The U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development recently awarded grants
  for scenario planning at regional and metropolitan scales that further promote this
  practice. However, a lack of systematic analysis of uncertainty limits the role
  of scenario planning.  Purpose: The purpose of this article is to demonstrate how
  to incorporate uncertainty into large-scale scenario analysis and then use that
  framework to identify contingent and robust plans.  Methods: We adapt the concepts
  of controllable internal options and uncontrol- lable external forces and consider
  their interactions in order to develop future scenarios and identify contingent
  and robust decisions. We then apply this technique using advanced econometric, land
  use, and transportation models developed for the Baltimore--Washington metropolitan
  region and its vicinity. Finally, based on the results of a hypothetical, yet plausible,
  exercise, we show how contingent and robust decisions can help local and regional
  governments develop contingent and robust plans.  Results and conclusions: Scenarios
  developed as a combination of internal options and external forces allow us to identify
  a wider range of future impacts than in traditional metropolitan scenario planning.
  Robust plans support choices that offer benefits across scenarios. Contingent plans
  can be tailored to specific futures.  Takeaway for practice: By providing a way
  to think systematically about uncer- tainty, scenario analysis promises to improve
  the efficacy of large-scale planning. '
