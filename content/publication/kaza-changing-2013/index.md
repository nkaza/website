abstract: Sprawling urbanisation has been the hallmark of development in United States.
  This study intends to provide a comprehensive overview of the changing urban landscape
  pat- terns between 2001 and 2006. Using the land cover data from US Geological Survey
  for these two years, I characterise the landscape metrics for each county in the
  continental United States. The changes in these metrics are correlated with the
  drivers of urbani- sation including socioeconomic variables. Uneven and heterogeneous
  patterns of growth in a country this large are not surprising. However, the metrics
  reveal that while urban counties are becoming less fragmented, some rural counties
  in South and Western United States are experiencing significant leapfrog development.
