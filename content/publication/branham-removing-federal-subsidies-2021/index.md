abstract: The federal government has implemented a variety of policies and subsidies
  that help coastal development remain viable, including investments in risk reduction
  measures, subsidized flood insurance, and post-disaster assistance. In this study,
  we explore how the removal of federal subsidies impacts coastal development patterns
  by measuring the causal effect of the U.S. Coastal Barrier Resources Act (CBRA)
  on building activity. Implemented in 1982, CBRA withdrew eligibility for federal
  funding for infrastructure, post-disaster assistance, and subsidized flood insurance
  along designated sections of coastal barriers (``CBRA units''). Using a novel built
  structures dataset, we employ a spatial regression discontinuity design to compare
  development rates inside and outside CBRA units in 1980 and 2016. We demonstrate
  that CBRA has caused significant reductions in development activity, with development
  rates in CBRA more than 75% lower than areas outside CBRA. Our findings suggest
  that policies like CBRA can be effective at slowing development in other sensitive
  or hazardous areas, and could help to preserve natural environments for habitat
  conservation and climate adaptation purposes.
