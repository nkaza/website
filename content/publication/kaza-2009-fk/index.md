abstract: 'The literature on planning assumes that plans, to be useful, should be
  public and then implemented. The participatory paradigm, with its recent resurgence,
  assumes that planning should be performed with stakeholders in public forums. This
  paper challenges the notion that plans and planning processes should be public in
  general or even within a group whose mandate it is to plan. It considers the inherent
  strategic reality of planning and interactions of multiple plans, existing and being
  made and being discarded, to argue for cases in which plans are and ought to be
  private and planning necessarily strategic and idiosyncratic. This paper addresses
  questions such as: In what circumstances will a plan maker choose to make plans
  public, to whom, and when? What should we expect to be public from the plans of
  others and what not? This paper will posit that plans are subsumed in plans about
  plans and that plans are strategically made explicit in public. The absence of public
  documents in particular situations should not be taken to imply that plans do not
  exist or that plan led behaviour is not occurring, inferable, or observable. Based
  in part on examples from New Orleans recovery planning, we then provide explanations
  of why and in what circumstances individuals, voluntary groups, and governments
  are likely to plan in public and make plans public. And we consider related but
  distinct justifications for what aspects of plans should be made public and in what
  circumstances.'
