abstract: If urban development plans were just target patterns to be achieved, conventional
  data structures in GIS would be sufficient. Urban development plans have a strong
  spatial component, but recent literature in planning emphasizes that plans are about
  actions and relationships among them. These relationships include interdependence,
  substitutability, priority, and parthood. In order to support planning, GIScience
  should devise data structures and queries to support reasoning with these relationships.
  This paper shows how relationships encoded within each of a set of plans, using
  a recently developed data model, can be used to infer the relationships of actions
  among these plans. Simple databases and use cases based on real situations in McHenry
  County, Illinois are used to demonstrate that these relationships can be encoded
  and queried. The results demonstrate that previously dis- covered semantic relationships
  can be used to discover additional relationships across plans, thereby enriching
  the decision making. The approach provides a systematic way of structuring the information
  in plans to support making and using plans.
