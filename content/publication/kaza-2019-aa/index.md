abstract: 'Categorizing places based on their network connections to other places
  in the regiom reveals not only population concentration but also economic dynamics
  that are missed in other typologies. The US Office of Management and Budget categorization
  of counties into metropolitan/micropolitan central/outlying is widely seen as insufficient
  for many analytic purposes. In this paper we use coreness index from network analysis
  to identify labor market centrality of a county. We use county-to-county commute
  flows, including internal commuting, to identify regional hierarchies. Indicators
  broken down by this typology reveal counterintuitive results in many cases. Population
  size and level of urbanisation is largely irrelevant to strong core counties. Employment
  in these strong core counties grew faster in the post-recession (2008-2015) than
  other types, that is missed by other typologies, suggesting that this categorization
  may be useful for regional analysis and policy. '
