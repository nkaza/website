abstract: Wide participation, in the urban planning context, is justified as the means
  of balancing multiple interests outside the traditional decision-making setup. However,
  this article argues that the participatory paradigm provides at best inadequate
  justification to the planning process. Particularly if consensus building is the
  aim of the participatory process, it suffers from a number of impossibility results
  well documented in the political economics literature. `Lazy deliberators' will
  arrive at the acceptance of a priori median prefer- ence, and participatory processes
  necessarily exclude some groups, even under equitable capability and power distribution.
  This article intends to contribute to the debate on the nature of participatory
  planning by critically analyzing the motivations of participation and limitation
  of the participatory planning paradigms, and advocates a temperate view on their
  efficacy.
