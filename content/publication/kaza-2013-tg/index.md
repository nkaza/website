abstract: Recently, as part of his Climate Action Plan, the Obama administration proposed
  that energy efficiency should be factored into mortgage underwriting upon the sale
  or refinancing of new and existing homes. Unfortunately, there is little empirical
  evidence on the relationship between energy efficiency and mortgage risks. Utilizing
  a unique dataset, we examine this relationship. More narrowly, we examine the performance
  of mortgages backed by Energy Star certified homes. We find that default and prepayment
  risks are significantly lower in certified homes. Even for Energy Star certified
  homes, more energy efficiency is associated with even lower loan risks.  These results
  offer support for taking energy efficiency into consideration in the mortgage underwriting
  process. Being the first of its kind, further research needs to replicate the present
  study with other data sets, over different time periods, and with alternative methodologies.
