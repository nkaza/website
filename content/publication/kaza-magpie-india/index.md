abstract: The measurement and characterization of urbanization crucially depends upon
  defining what counts as urban. According to The Indian Planning Commission, less
  than a third of the Indian population lives in urban areas, and while Indian cities
  are increasingly important to the economy, India is perceived fundamentally as a
  rural country. In this paper, we show that this received wisdom is an artefact of
  the definition of urbanity and the official statistics vastly undercount the level
  of urbanization and its importance for development policies in India.We begin by
  creating temporally-consistent, high-resolution population maps from sub district
  level population data available from the Indian Census for 2001 and 2011. The modeling
  framework is a two-step process that applies a Random Forest-based model to generate
  a prediction weighting layer subsequently used to inform a gridded dasymetric redistribution
  of original census counts at 100 m resolution (Stevens et al. 2015). We then apply
  density thresholds, contiguity conditions, distance based clustering and minimum
  population sizes to construct urban agglomerations for the entire country. Compared
  to the official estimates, we find that this approach counts 8%-30% (depending on
  thresholds) more urban population in 2011. We find large urban agglomerations that
  span large portions of Kerala and the Gangetic plain. Thus, while official estimates
  count more cities in the country, we delineate fewer cities but large urban regions
  that span jurisdictional boundaries. This has implication for urban policies.
