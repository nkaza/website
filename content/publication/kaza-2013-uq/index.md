abstract: This paper explores the spatial and temporal patterns of green building
  in the commercial and institutional sector in the U.S. While these buildings are
  becoming more common place, they have yet to reach a critical mass to affect the
  entire construction industry. Given the potential for green building practices to
  reduce energy consumption and carbon emissions, we seek to understand the geography
  of green building. Using multiple metrics, we explain the patterning of geography
  of LEED and Energy Star certified buildings in the United States. We find strong
  evidence of clustering at the metropolitan and sub-metropolitan scales. This exploratory
  research serves as a foundation for future research aimed at specifying the nature
  of agglomerative processes in green buildings.
