abstract: Urban development relies on many factors to remain viable, including federal
  assistance with infrastructure development. The 1982 US Coastal Barrier Resources
  Act (CoBRA) prohibits federal financial assistance for infrastructure, post-storm
  disaster relief, and flood insurance in designated sections (system units) of coastal
  barriers.  How has CoBRA's removal of these subsidies affected rates and types of
  urban development? Using building footprint and real estate data (n=1,385,552 parcels),
  we compare density of built structures, land use types, and land values within and
  outside of system units in eight southeastern US states. Here we show that CoBRA
  is associated with reduced development rates in coastal barrier zones, but also
  reveal how withdrawal of federal subsidies might be counteracted by local responses.
  As attention increases towards improving development policy in high hazard areas,
  this work contributes to understanding how limitations on infrastructure subsidies
  can affect outcomes under overlapping jurisdictions with competing goals.
