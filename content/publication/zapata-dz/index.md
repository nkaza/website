abstract: 'The use of scenario planning in urban and regional planning practice has
  grown in the last decade as one way to face uncertainty. However, in adapting scenario
  planning from its origins in the business sector, planners have eliminated two key
  components: 1) the use of multiple scenarios, and 2) the inclusion of diverse organisations,
  people and interests through deep deliberations. We argue that this shift limits
  the ability for planners to plan for multiple plausible and futures that are shaped
  by an increasing number of diverse actors. In this paper, we use case study research
  to exam how uncertainty was considered in four scenario planning processes. We analyzed
  and compared the cases based analytical categories related to multiple futures and
  diversity. We found that the processes that used multiple, structurally distinct
  scenarios explored a wider range of topics and issues shaping places. All four relied
  heavily on professional stakeholders as the scenario developers, limiting public
  input. Only those processes that included multiple futures captured the differential
  effects scenarios would have on diverse people and interests. '
