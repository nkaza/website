abstract: 'Because these energy expenditures are fairly inelastic, their effects on
  low-income households may be significant, due to the po tential for energy consumption
  to displace other types of consumption when energy prices rise. This is particularly
  true for transportation energy consumption. We test the hypothesis that low and
  moderate income re sidents are less likely default, when they are located in more
  accessible places and find that regional accessibility has almost no effect on risk
  s of default, but local job diversity has moderate mitigating effect. '
