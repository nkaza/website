abstract: U.S. regulations require offsets for aquatic ecosystems damaged during land
  development, often through restoration of alternative resources. What effect does
  large scale wetland and stream restoration have on surrounding land values? Restoration
  effects on real estate values have substantial implications for protecting resources,
  increasing tax base, and improving environmental policies. Our analysis focuses
  on the three county Raleigh---Durham--Chapel Hill, North Carolina region, which
  has experienced rapid development and extensive aquatic ecological restoration (through
  the state's Ecosystem Enhancement Program [EEP]). Since restoration sites are not
  randomly distributed across space, we used a genetic algorithm to match parcels
  near restoration sites with comparable control parcels. Similar to propensity score
  analysis, this technique facilitates statistical comparison and isolates the effects
  of restoration sites on surrounding real estate values. Compared to parcels not
  proximate to any aquatic resources, we found that, 1) natural aquatic systems steadily
  and significantly increase parcel values up to 0.75 miles away, and 2) parcels <
  0.5 mi from EEP restoration sites have significantly lower sale prices, while 3)
  parcels > 0.5 mi from EEP sites gain substantial amenity value. When we control
  for intervening water bodies (e.g. unrestored streams and wetlands), we find a similar
  inflection point whereby parcels < 0.5 mi from EEP sites exhibit lower values, and
  sites 0.5-- 0.75 mi away exhibit increased values. Our work points to the need for
  higher public visibility of aquatic ecosystem restoration programs and increased
  public information about their value.
