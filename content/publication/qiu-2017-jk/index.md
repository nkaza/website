abstract: The Department of Energy's Clean Cities program was created in 1993 to reduce
  petroleum usage in the transportation sector. The program promotes alternative fuels
  such as biofuels and fuel-saving strategies such as idle reduction and fleet management
  through coalitions of local government, non-profit, and private actors. Few studies
  have evaluated the impact of the program because of its complexity that include
  interrelated strategies of grants, education and training and diversity of participants.
  This paper uses a Difference-in-Differences (DiD) approach to evaluate the effectiveness
  of the program between 1990 and 2010. We quantify the effectiveness of the Clean
  Cities program by focusing on performance measures such as air quality, number of
  alternative fueling stations, private vehicle occupancy and transit ridership. We
  find that counties that participate in the program perform better on all these measures
  compared to counties that did not participate. Compared to the control group, counties
  in the Clean Cities program experienced a reduction in days with bad air quality
  (3.7%), a decrease in automobile commuters (2.9%), an overall increase in transit
  commuters (2.1%) and had greater numbers of new alternative fueling stations (12.9).
  The results suggest that the program is a qualified success.
