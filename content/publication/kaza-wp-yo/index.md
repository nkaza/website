abstract: In metropolitan regions, urban form is usually associated with pollutant
  levels. However, empirical analyses have relied on small samples and demographic
  variables of urban form. In this paper, we study the relationships between urban
  form indicators derived from land cover data and emissions for all of the conterminous
  United States. We use a spatial error model to identify to test if the urban form
  indicators, and in particular mixing of urban and forest land cover has effect on
  emissions. We find that fragmentary patterns are associated with higher emissions
  but these emissions are mitigated when there is a mixing of forest and urban land
  cover. This points to a nuanced understanding of the implications of sprawling city
  development on air quality.
