abstract: Plan quality evaluations have used conformance of the plan to standards
  or their use in subsequent deliberations as metrics. In this study, we argue that
  plans could be evaluated using other criteria such as utility for different users.
  We use the energy planning of thirty-five American Indian tribes as a case study
  to demonstrate this evaluation methodology. American Indian tribes have used energy
  planning to address interdependencies of mineral rights with economic development
  and tribal sovereignty as well environmental stewardship under uncertainty.  Our
  evaluation methodology explicitly acknowledges the complexity of information presented
  in the plans and evaluates them holistically with an eye towards plan users, who
  may be different from the plan makers. We evaluate whether or not interdependencies
  among actions are addressed and what types of uncertainties are explicitly 15considered
  and in what ways. This framework helps identify how different plan elements are
  useful for different entities.
