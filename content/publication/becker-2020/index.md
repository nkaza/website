title: 'Tale of Two Sprawls: Energy planning and challenges for Smart Growth 2.0'
subtitle: ''
summary: 'Smart growth principles have focused on land use and transportation connections while ignoring the underlying energy infrastructure. In this chapter we explore ways to decrease energy consumption and increase renewable generation while upholding the goals of Smart Growth. Smart Growth policies promoting compact development can lessen transportation and building energy use. However, decarbonisation of the energy systems has the potential to create its own sprawl due to low energy density of renewables. In this chapter, we explore the challenges and opportunities associated with integrating energy planning principles into regional urban growth management. Land use guidelines can be used to lessen the institutional and physical barriers to reducing fossil fuel consumption and energy sprawl.'
