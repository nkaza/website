abstract: Historic reference behavior and archetypes of system structure are key tools
  for creating rigorous system dynamics (SD) models. Modelers often delineate causal
  relationships by employing common archetypes of dynamic system structure, which
  produce behaviors such as growth and decline, oscillation, and complex combinations
  thereof. We extend archetypes to spatial-dynamic models, focusing on structural
  archetypes that exhibit changing spatial patterns in two-dimensional landscapes.
  Although many fields employ spatial modeling techniques, analogy-based, causally
  focused system archetypes remain confined to non-spatial SD models. We draw on spatial
  analysis literature to explore the influence of space on dynamic relationships and
  archetypes, including methods for articulating ÒspaceÓ and expressing feedback.
  We offer simple examples of spatial system archetypes and explore network structures
  for spatially extending SD models. By doing this, we argue for spatial modeling
  techniques that parallel the learn-by-analogy environment that archetypes have promoted
  in aspatial SD research.
