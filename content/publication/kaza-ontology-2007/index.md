abstract: The focus of geographic and other ontologies of urban devel- opment has
  been to represent locations with object attributes or objects with locational attributes.
  Urban information systems should also repre- sent decisions, which have or could
  have locational attributes. Develop- ment processes are critically influenced by
  expectations about declared intentions manifest through plans and records of decisions.
  This paper provides an ontology of decision situations characterized by actors par-
  ticipating, intentions expressed, and alternatives considered. We argue that these
  elements are closely tied to and interdependent with other aspects of urban ontologies,
  which typically focus on physical objects of development. An ontology of plans and
  decisions will enable sharing of information among actors and consideration of disparate
  and distributed information.
