abstract: To date, most planners have focussed on energy consumption. They argue that
  compact housing and urban patterns reduce both household and transportation energy
  use and should be promoted to combat a variety of ills, including energy import
  dependency and climate change. However, planners also have a strong role to play
  in energy production, particularly with the increasing adoption of renewable forms
  of energy. Planners will play an integral part in harmonising local land use regulations
  and policies that will either promote or hinder these technologies. In this paper,
  we survey the literature and point to environmental and other land use issues that
  are pertinent to different types of centralised, distributed, conventional and renewable
  energy production.
