abstract: The need for models that forecast land use change spans many disciplines.
  Pattern-based models were the first in which projections of change at specific locations
  in actual landscapes could be predicted. In contrast, recent economic models have
  modeled the underlying behavioral process that produces land use change. This paper
  combines attributes from each approach into a hybrid model using Multiple Discrete
  Continuous Extreme Value formulation that allows for multiple conversion types while
  estimating the intensity of each type of conversion. We demonstrate the simulation
  routine for three county region in Maryland, which successfully predicts a majority
  of growth by type, time, and location at a disaggregate scale.
