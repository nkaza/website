abstract: 'Considerable research on the risks of obesity and chronic diseases has
  focused on the relationships between where people live, where they shop, and the
  types of food they purchase. Rarely have investigators used a national sample and
  explicitly addressed whether people use neighborhood food stores to purchase food.
  Even more rarely have previous studies accounted for the broader built environment
  characteristics in which people live, access resources, socialize, and shop for
  food. We examined whether the cross-sectional associations between availability
  of neighborhood convenience stores and supermarkets and self-reported household
  annual expenditures for snacks and beverages still held after including regional
  destination accessibility, availability and diversity of neighborhood destinations,
  and neighborhood street connectivity. Our study included 49,048 households in 2010,
  located in 378 metropolitan areas in the continental United States. Households purchased
  more snacks if they lived in neighborhoods with many convenience stores. Access
  to unhealthy food includes a consideration of geographic proximity. The broader
  built environment characteristics was associated with food purchase, although the
  magnitude was small. '
