abstract: Plans provide information about how multiple decisions are structured over
  time, and what the intentions of a particular actor are. As and when these decisions
  get made, or not made, some parts of plans become irrelevant, while some other new
  relationships are discovered and considered. Recognising this provides a useful
  way to interpret the changes in plans by tracking the decisions and vice versa.
  In this paper, we illustrate the complexities of an ontology of urban systems which
  are needed to ensure the currency of plans, so that they could be effectively used
  in urban decision making. Especially, when actors are numerous, jurisdictions overlap,
  actions are interdependent and interests are unstable, this framework enables us
  to think about plans in a complex and changing urban environment and make them so
  that they remain useful.
