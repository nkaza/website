abstract: Shoreline armoring, which involves the installation of hardened structures
  to protect coastal property, dramatically alters shoreline composition and resulting
  ecological functions. Accelerating hazard threats to growing coastal communities
  compounds this problem, creating demand for more armoring. We examine whether designation
  by the U.S. Coastal Barrier Resources Act (CBRA) -- enacted to disincentivize urban
  development on hazardous coastal barriers -- is associated with lower propensities
  to armor shorelines. In designated areas, CBRA removes access to federally-subsidized
  flood insurance, infrastructure subsidies, and disaster assistance. Using logistic
  regression modeling, we examine armoring at the parcel scale across the State of
  Florida (USA), controlling for CBRA designation, land use, and local population
  density. Our findings reveal a significant negative relationship between CBRA designation
  and the odds of armoring, particularly for residential and vacant properties. As
  coastal areas grapple with increasing impacts from coastal hazards, removal of public
  subsidies may be an effective non-regulatory method for maintaining the ecological
  and protective benefits of natural shorelines.
