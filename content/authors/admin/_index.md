I work at the intersection of urbanization patterns, local energy policy and equity. In my research, I seek to understand the motivations, intentions and plans of multiple actors endowed with limited capabilities, imperfect foresight and distributed authority, in urban settings. Lately, I have been studying these issues in the context of local energy planning. I routinely use high cadence, large geospatial and temporal datasets and novel quantitative methods in my research. I am also a planning theorist, specialising in organisational decision-making, institutional restructuring and the role of plans. In addition to my faculty appointments in the [City & Regional Planning](http://planning.unc.edu) and  the [Environment, Ecology & Energy program](http://e3p.unc.edu) at the [University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill](http://www.unc.edu), I direct the the [Center for Urban and Regional Studies](http://curs.unc.edu).  I am also a faculty fellow at the [Insitute for the Enviroment](http://ie.unc.edu).
