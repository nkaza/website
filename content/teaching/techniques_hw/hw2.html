<h2>Task</h2>
<p>The National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administrationâ€™s Coastal Change Analysis program produces land cover on the coast of the US. Download the 1996,2001,2006 and 2010 landcover data for the state of North Carolina from <a href="https://coast.noaa.gov/ccapftp/#/">here</a>. Answer the following questions and write a report summarising the findings.</p>
<ul>
<li>Download the county vector files using <code>tigris</code> or the Census website. How much urban land exists in each county on the NC coast? How has it changed over time?</li>
<li>How have different types of wetlands changed in quantity over time?</li>
<li>Where have the wetlands become more fragmented and which indices are good for measuring fragmentation of the wetlands in NC coast? _ How is the fragmentation of wetland related to fragmentary urban development in these counties?</li>
<li>Relate the population growth in each county to the wetland fragmentation. Annual population estimates at the county level can be downladed from the <a href="https://seer.cancer.gov/popdata/">National Cancer Institute</a></li>
