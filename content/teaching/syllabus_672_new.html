<h1>Course Description &amp; Objectives</h1>
<p>This course is about different techniques used in assembling, managing, analysing and predicting using heterogeneous data sets in urban environments. These data sets that are inherently messy and incomplete. Types of data include, point, polygon, raster, vector, text, image and network data; data sets with high cadence and high spatial resolution. This is a survey course for different techniques and approaches in dealing with these data in R. The objective of these analytical techniques is to inform both short term operational decisions and long term planning in cities. As such, the emphasis is on practical urban data analytics rather than in-depth discussion about the suitability and appropriateness of techniques and their associated theoretical assumptions.</p>
<p>Unlike other courses of similar vein, I put inordinate emphasis on data visualisation and communication. The point of data analysis is to tell a compelling story, not to use latest analytical techniques.</p>
<p>This is a companion course to <a href="https://planning.unc.edu/courses/673/"><em>PLAN 673: The Ethics and Politics of New Urban Analytics</em></a> (Seminar), which deals with problems, opportunities and hidden agendas with data generation, analysis and visualisation in urban settings. Students are encouraged to take them both.</p>

<div id="prerequisites-preparation" class="section level1">
<h1>Prerequisites &amp; Preparation</h1>
<p>The course will move quickly, cover a large number of analytical techniques, data sets, use cases and disciplinary domains. It requires significant investment on the part of the students to learn the technical skills as well as to learn about substantive urban and regional analyses.</p>
<p>Much of the work in this course will be done using Open Source Software that is usually free.</p>
<p>While it is not a prerequisite, the course assumes a working knowledge of <a href="http://www.%20r-project.org">R</a>. R is a programming language and a free software environment for statistical computing and graphics. There are a number of online resources that will help you with getting up to speed with R. You will have to use extensively the documentation, help and examples that R environment provides; i.e. Do not be afraid to use, for example,</p>
<pre class="r"><code>?qplot
??randomForest</code></pre>
<p>to seek help for specific commands.</p>
<p>One disadvantage with R is that it stores all its objects in memory. This means that your computer should have significant RAM to deal with large data sets.</p>
<p>Another disadvantage with R is that it has a <a href="http://cockeyed.com/lessons/learning_curve/learning_curve.php"><em>shallow learning curve</em></a>. And it has some quirks. In particular, please pay attention to <a href="https://www.burns-stat.com/pages/Tutor/R_inferno.pdf">R-Inferno</a>. However, persistence will have long term benefits.</p>
<p>You should have an aptitude for debugging computer code, thinking through edge cases in data sets, identifying and dealing with missing data and messy data sets.</p>
<p>You should expect that the instructions and help provided may not work on your system due to different configurations, mismatched data types and differences in libraries. You should have an aptitude to troubleshoot the problems and figure out workarounds.</p>
<p>It may be helpful to go through the materials from <a href="https://supermariogiacomazzo.github.io/STOR320_WEBSITE/">STOR 320: Introduction to Data Science</a></p>

<h1>Textbooks &amp; Readings</h1>
<p>The following books are used implicitly in the class. You are not required to buy any of them but they are very useful to have on your bookshelf.</p>

</p>
<p>All the above books are about principles of information display and design rather than about data analysis techniques. Information visualisation is very important and much more so than analytical techniques though enough attention is not devoted to them. While we may not be using these textbooks explicitly in weekly readings, you are expected to critically engage with the materials and thoughtfully follow the principles laid out in the books throughout the course.</p>
<p>For general purpose statistics, I have always enjoyed Tim Harford’s podcast called <a href="https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p02nrss1/episodes/downloads">More or Less</a>. He has a recent book out that succinctly details the attitudes you want to take towards data analysis and telling stories with data. I highly recommend his new book.</p>

<div id="course-policies" class="section level1">
<h1>Course Policies</h1>
<p>The following set of course policies is not meant as an exhaustive list. If in doubt, ask for permission and clarification.</p>
<div id="logistics" class="section level2">
<h2>Logistics</h2>
<ul>
<li><p>Your health and well-being is of paramount importance. You may also be primary care givers and might have substantial and increased demands on your time. You may not be able meet the requirements of the course, for any number of other reasons. Reach out to me, if you need any help, including if you need extensions or want to take an Incomplete or deal with it differently. I will deal with these on ad-hoc basis.</p></li>
<li><p>I don’t need any advance notification for intermittent absences. You should make appropriate judgments based on your health and your peers. However, you are responsible for keeping up with the material. Because the materials are posted on-line and in advance, you should be able to work through the code. If you have issues, please use Microsoft Teams, Office Hours and other resources available to you.</p></li>
<li><p>Microsoft Teams will be used for troubleshooting and announcements. Sakai will continue to be used for HW, lab and assignment submissions. In addition, please create an account on <a href="https://rstudio.cloud/">rstudio.cloud</a> (see below). You can sign in using your Github login.</p></li>
<li><p>You should expect that the datasets you will need to download may not be available, because of server outages and lack of personnel to attend to these outages. We will cross those bridges, when we get to them.</p></li>
<li><p>All bets are off, if I fall ill. Hopefully, there is enough course infrastructure already set up for you to achieve the learning objectives on your own. The department will figure out how to assign grades, in that eventuality.</p></li>
</ul>
</div>
<div id="deadlines-extension-requests" class="section level2">
<h2>Deadlines &amp; Extension Requests</h2>
<p>Completed lab session materials are due by the end of lab (6 PM) in Sakai. You only need to submit one lab work for each topic.</p>
<p>Homework assigned for the week is due on the deadline specified in Sakai.</p>
<p>If there is a reason to extend the deadline for the entire class, please discuss with me at least a week ahead and make a cogent case.</p>
<p>All labs and homework needs to be submitted as two files 1) a R markdown file (*.Rmd) and 2) html output (*.html) of the Markdown file.</p>
</div>
<div id="readingsresources" class="section level2">
<h2>Readings/Resources</h2>
<p>The weekly readings are provided as resources and references. You are not required to read all the materials in detail. But the readings are useful to learn the material in depth and troubleshoot some issues. In some cases, the software and techniques in the Resources may be dated. Please use the web to adapt and update them.</p>
</div>
<div id="tutorials" class="section level2">
<h2>Tutorials</h2>
<p>Often labs are accompanied by tutorials. The tutorials are usually self-contained and self-explanatory. In R, there are multiple ways to achieve the results, each with their own advantages and disadvantages. The tutorials may include different ways of data munging and analysis to expose you to different techniques. It is not implied that one is better than the others, though we all have our own preferences. If in doubt, rely on <a href="https://www.alexejgossmann.com/benchmarking_r/">benchmarking</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="equipment" class="section level2">
<h2>Equipment</h2>
<p>We will conduct the class in the New East lab. However, it would be helpful if every student has a working laptop that has <a href="https://www.r-project.org/">R</a> and <a href="https://www.rstudio.com/">Rstudio</a> installed. The laptops should have sufficient memory and processing speed to deal with large data sets. If you have access to no such equipment, please see me immediately to discuss options.</p>
</div>
<div id="grading" class="section level2">
<h2>Grading</h2>
<p>While all assignments are posted on this website, they are to be submitted exclusively on Sakai and on time. Please refrain from emailing your submissions to the instructor or the TA.</p>
<p>I am going to use a ‘Specification Grading’ in this course.</p>
<ul>
<li><p>Lab reports to be submitted at the end of the class (6 PM). (Individual/Collaborative)</p></li>
<li><p>(Mostly) weekly homework (HW) programming assignments (Individual/Collaborative)</p></li>
<li><p>Critique of a data visualisation. (Assignment 1) (Group)</p></li>
<li><p>Final term project. (Assignment 2) (Individual)</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The assignments will be graded on an Satisfactory/Unsatisfactory scale. Satisfactory grade is equivalent to a B+ letter grade. The focus of these assignments is on learning outcomes such as mastery of the material, making innovative connections in the material and on-time submission.</p>
<p>You will need to achieve Satisfactory grades on at least 5 HW and 5 labs and at least one of the major assignments to achieve a L (equivalent to a C grade). Fewer than 4 Satisfactory grades in labs and HW will result in a failing grade. In addition to the Satisfactory grades in 7 labs and 7 HW, Satisfactory grades should be achieved in the both the major assignments to achieve a P.</p>
<p>Exceptional performance in the final term project, in addition to Satisfactory grade in 9 labs and 9 HW the other requirements, will result in H/A grade.</p>
<p>This grading scale will be adjusted if the deliverables change depending course progress.</p>
</div>
<div id="consent-to-share" class="section level2">
<h2>Consent to Share</h2>
<p>I am reserving the right to post your ungraded submissions (including HW) in Sakai (restricted to the class) for current and future students, as examples, without comment or recommendation. If you wish to decline to consent, please send me a note. No explanation is necessary and opting out does not affect your grades.</p>
</div>
<div id="attendance-and-participation" class="section level2">
<h2>Attendance and Participation</h2>
<p>If you don’t attend classes, but submit the requirements on time, there is no penalty. Group assignments will get a single grade for the group. Continuous absences that affect the progress in the course should be discussed with the instructor to figure out remedial action.</p>
</div>
<div id="e-mail" class="section level2">
<h2>E-mail</h2>
<p>Sakai messaging system should be the preferred way to communicate with the instructor. Before you email either of us about homework or lab sessions, you should use resources on the web and on Sakai. Google, Stack Overflow and <a href="https://teams.microsoft.com/l/team/19%3aNkXCQbygFozl8aV0IqzNPKvZiwy4N0WPBtL9a7XTsPA1%40thread.tacv2/conversations?groupId=f82e1428-94d4-4019-97fb-38d4e694e3e7&amp;tenantId=58b3d54f-16c9-42d3-af08-1fcabd095666">Microsoft Teams</a> are your friends.</p>
</div>
<div id="asynchronous-communication-troubleshooting" class="section level2">
<h2>Asynchronous Communication &amp; Troubleshooting</h2>
<p>We will use Microsoft Teams for asynchronous communication and troubleshooting. We can follow guidelines like these that allow you to get to answers quickly:</p>
<ul>
<li><p><a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask" class="uri">https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask</a></p></li>
<li><p><a href="https://codereview.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask" class="uri">https://codereview.stackexchange.com/help/how-to-ask</a></p></li>
</ul>
<p>We will use <a href="https://rstudio.cloud">RStudio Cloud</a> for troubleshooting in this course. Think of RStudio Cloud as an instance of RStudio in the cloud where you can share not only your script but also the whole environment. This increases the likelihood that others can replicate your results or troubles. <a href="/teaching/remote-instruction-672/">Instructions are located here</a>.</p>
</div>
<div id="academic-conduct" class="section level2">
<h2>Academic Conduct</h2>
<p>I firmly believe in learning from your peers and from others. All homework and lab submissions could benefit from collaborations, however, the submissions are individual. This means that interpreting the data and the results, producing the visualisations, drawing appropriate conclusions from the data, is necessarily individual even when the strategies can be discussed and developed with others. <strong>All help including fragments of borrowed code</strong>, however, should be explicitly acknowledged. Severe penalties are imposed for non-attribution. In particular, please pay attention to the copyright restrictions and attribution requirements associated with the R-code that you might find elsewhere.</p>
</div>
<div id="additional-help" class="section level2">
<h2>Additional Help</h2>
<p>Please set up a time on <a href="https://nikhilkaza.youcanbook.me/">my calendar</a> to discuss any additional help you may require.</p>
<p>I strongly recommend that you avail yourself of the <a href="http://ropenlabs.web.unc.edu/">R open labs</a> run by <a href="https://guides.lib.unc.edu/lorinbruckner">Lorin Bruckner</a> and <a href="https://guides.lib.unc.edu/mattjansen">Matt Jensen</a>.</p>
<p>You can also request additional help from Lorin and Matt by setting up appointments with them from their website. In addition, Odum Institute has <a href="https://odum.unc.edu/research-support/quantitative-analysis/">walk-in consultations</a> and some of them have expertise in R.</p>
<p><a href="https://library.unc.edu/about/staff/philip-mcdaniel/">Phil McDaniel</a> and <a href="https://guides.lib.unc.edu/amandahenley">Amanda Henley</a> are excellent resources for tracking down geospatial datasets and troubleshooting issues with them.</p>
<p>You will probably extensively use Stack Overflow to troubleshoot and debug your code. Please be mindful of how you <a href="https://stackoverflow.com/help/how-to-ask">should ask questions on Stack Overflow</a> including providing minimum reproducible code and datasets.</p>
<p>There are organisations that are devoted to ensuring diversity in the R community. See for example, R-ladies <a href="https://rladies.org/">meetup groups</a> and <a href="https://rladies-community-slack.herokuapp.com/">Slack channels</a>. Local groups may or may not be active.</p>

<h5>HW 2</h5>
<p>In the tutorial, we used data for O<span class="math inline">\(_3\)</span>, a Criteria Air Polluatant (CAP). In this homework perform similar analysis for NO<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>, another CAP. For this you will need to download the data from <a href="https://aqs.epa.gov/aqsweb/airdata/download_files.html">EPA</a> and clean it.</p>
<p>You will need to tell a story about this pollutant and its distribution (in various senses). You may consider the following questions to structure your anlayses. In no way, these are exhaustive. Feel free to tell the story that interests you.</p>
<ul>
<li>How many sensors are measuring NO<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>?</li>
<li>Of what percentage of the year are the NO<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span> sensors active? Where are the sensors that are not active? Map them.</li>
<li>How does the geographical distribution of NO<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span> AQI differ from that of O<span class="math inline">\(_3\)</span></li>
<li>Which cities (CBSA, not counties) are worst affected by NO<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span>?</li>
<li>Does the spatial extent of the CBSA matter? (i.e. if you use the 2000 definitions of MSA vs 2018 definitions of CBSA does your conclusions change? Hint: Modifiable Areal Unit Problem)</li>
<li>Is there a correlation between NO<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span> and O<span class="math inline">\(_3\)</span>? Do different correlations matter? (i.e. correlations among AQIs of NO<span class="math inline">\(_2\)</span> and O<span class="math inline">\(_3\)</span> at site level, vs correlation of days AQI&gt;100 at CBSA level etc.)</li>
<li>What does the scatterplot look like? What does facetting the scatter plot by state tell us (pick 5 or so states)?</li>
<li>Link this with other data (temperature, population etc.)? Where to acquires these datasets? How to link them?</li>

<h5>HW 5</h5>
<p>In this week’s homework, I want you to analyse tweets in/referencing a city of your choice (e.g. Chicago). You are welcome to use a package that makes this easy for you such as <code>twitteR</code> or <code>rtweet</code>. However, you will need to set up a developer account and acquire credentials. (Hint: You may follow this <a href="https://rpubs.com/eduRodrigues/RetrievingTweets">tutorial</a>). The key tasks are think through the following issues and write a story.</p>
<ul>
<li>Analyse the sentiments of the tweets</li>
<li>Think through how the sentiments are changing</li>
<li>Do official accounts (such as @cta and @cta311) differ in the tweets compared to general public?</li>
<li>How prevalent is the location information in the tweets? i.e. Are the tweets useful to planners to pin point issues and track them?</li>
<li>Is twitter a useful mechanism to identify prevalence of sexual assault in public spaces such as transit?</li>
</ul>
<p>As usual, you are welcome to choose the scope and the above are not meant to be exhaustive.</p>
<p>Note that you will need to use your own credentials and submitting them using a Rmd file might reveal them to me and to your classmates. To prevent this, I am asking you to only submit an html file.</p>

<p>An input output table is a square matrix with rows representing originating industry sector and columns representing destination industry sector. The value in each cell represents the flow from one sector to another. The higher the number, the more tightly connected the two industries are.</p>
<p>Download the Multi-Regional Input Output Matrix for China from <a href="https://www.nature.com/articles/sdata2018155"><span class="citation">(<a href="#ref-miMultiregionalInputoutputTable2018" role="doc-biblioref">Mi et al. 2018</a>)</span></a></p>
<p>In this example, each node would be a combination of region-industry and the weight on the link is the interaction (flows) between the two nodes. There are 30 regions and 30 industries, so the full graph could potentially have 900 nodes and 810000 links (lot of them have zero or near zero weights). Note that this matrix is not symmetric and the diagonal elements are non-zero</p>
<p>Do some data cleaning and explicitly convert the matrix to graph/network. In particular, be explicit about thresholds that you will use to include the links in your network.</p>
<p>Tell a story about this network, by looking at (but not limited to) the following questions.</p>
<ol style="list-style-type: decimal">
<li><p>Identify the central region-industries in the entire network by constructing a betweenness centrality score. What can you conclude about the spatio-economic structure of China from these.</p></li>
<li><p>What other centrality measures are appropriate for this network and why?</p></li>
<li><p>Partition this network into communities using at least two different community detection algorithms. Do these results make intuitive sense?</p></li>
<li><p>Pick a subset of industries in your favourite region and create a subgraph of all the region-industries they are linked to. Identify the potential disrupters of this subgraph. Are these different from considering the entire flow pattern?</p></li>
<li><p>What is the relationship with this industry network with other network (labor markets, migration flows, road infrastructure etc.). Are there any connections you can draw? For this, you may have to scour the web for different datasets. Some of your classmates who are Mandarin speakers are probably better suited for this task. Again none of these are mandatory.</p></li>

<h5>HW 8</h5>
<p>Efforts to protect development along the coast through the placement of coastal protection infrastructure have fundamentally changed the composition of shorelines along the U.S. coast (Gittman et al. 2015). Coastal protection infrastructure, also called shoreline armoring, are physical structures typically made of rock or concrete that are placed along ocean-facing and inland shorelines in order to either (a) offer protection from storm surges and flooding, or (b) stabilize coastal land and halt erosion. Examples of these types of structures include seawalls, riprap, rock revetments, and bulkheads. These protections rarely accomplish their goals. Despite this, owners (including govts.) continue to invest in this infrastructure.</p>
<p>In this homework, I want you to test the efficacy of different predictive (non-linear) model of whether or not a parcel is armored or not. The data set is coastal parcels for two counties in FL (posted in Sakai), which contains the variable <code>type</code> that refers to whether th parcel is armored or not. TYou have a wide range of options with regards to the predictors. You are welcome to construct additional predictors by taking advantage of the parcel boundaries and location (such as distance to highway interchange or size of the parcel etc.). Make sure that report on your preferred predictive model based on different accuracy statistics and validation. What are the most important/useful predictors?</p>

<p><a href="https://fbaum.unc.edu">Frank Baumgartner’s</a> most recent book is <em>Suspect Citizens</em> (Cambridge, 2018), focusing on racial differences in the outcomes of routine traffic stops. In this homework, I want you to analyse a small portion of the summary dataset (by police agency), I acquired from him, to identify clusters of patterns. You are welcome to choose a subset of the variables, but you should pick at least some “Stop” and “Search” variables such as “Total stops” and “Total number of searches of Hispanic drivers.” Noting that the data is from different years, construct a reasonable ‘cross-sectional’ dataset and tell a compelling story about the nature of traffic stops in the United States. The dataset, along with the code book is posted on Sakai.</p>
